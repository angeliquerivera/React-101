## Hero Section

- Typically the first thing that a vistor to your website sees and is meant to provide the initial information and hook to engage with your site's content.

### Things that can be featured on the hero section:

- 1. Service offered
- 2. Credentials/why people should trust you
- 3. Benefits of working with you
- 4. Call to action (what they should do next)

### Common Hero Section elements
